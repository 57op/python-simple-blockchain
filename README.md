### Very simple blockchain (*partial*) implementation in Python (3.6)
It's nothing serious, I was just trying to understand better how the blockchain works.
Transactions and blocks are stored in plain JSON on filesystem for visualization purposes.
Source code needs to be tidied up, but whenever I'm in the mood I'll try adding more features before.

### Explanation
I uploaded a 14 blocks depth blockchain (all mined by Alice).
There's just a single transaction (`985777eac46108b05259e54037efd996b6c052562f61ddc85acd9698763b499b`) in which Alice sent some value to Bob, the rest are *coinbase* transactions.

```
{
    "uuid": "2078f099633011e8b40ad05099801ca2",
    "vin": [
        {
            "tx": "093c101a53e43e25893f04631e70ea86a64628ba982e85bf59d8ebe3be38fd0f",
            "vout": 0,
            "signature": "d1601f5b669f36ec3f57ab01d3e7948bacef475be57bcd456684c960e1333e79cb34d81ceff9e2271c7b75eba8ffb3961315b66b21262f423e82347695714446",
            "pubkey": "021ea0ffb5a7fd37acd2dffcfeeff59f27214c592bc91a4da6bd92ac92a26912e7"
        }
    ],
    "vout": [
        {
            "value": 10,
            "address": "1GQeNtP9LjnYp3hepAfiXi2MhvVTp71aZM"
        },
        {
            "value": 15,
            "address": "1MmWbFY4dwsovy93zSjC2BkRZ43LU7cbhT"
        }
    ]
}
```
As you can see there's no locking script in the output, nor unlocking script in the input.
The transaction verification is not dynamic like in bitcoin,it's static.
So, basically, only a P2PKH is allowed.
To unlock an output, it's verified that the public key generates the same public address and then it verifies that the signature was generated by that public key.
The signature message is the hash of transaction containing the output you want to spend (`093c101a53e43e25893f04631e70ea86a64628ba982e85bf59d8ebe3be38fd0f` signed with Alice's privte key).

The transaction was mined in the block `0004acc3d1204e2a2bd8e9951f65c8d2361488d25e9db42e66ac177c36bc6dbe`

```
{
    "previous_block": "000e1dd82f4ec2a37c8f73c86bdeb0c898975aaf0f133948d96938c7250706b7",
    "checksum": "0004acc3d1204e2a2bd8e9951f65c8d2361488d25e9db42e66ac177c36bc6dbe",
    "nonce": 12245,
    "transactions": [
        "e4b0822fb23eb03b2f08568fc55fc5a41c9d81423fcd7601a06eb014d2def0bc",
        "985777eac46108b05259e54037efd996b6c052562f61ddc85acd9698763b499b"
    ]
}
```
